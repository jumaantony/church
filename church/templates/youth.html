                In 1962, the then Bishop of (the former) Mt. Kenya Diocese, the late Obadiah Kariuki, had a vision for young people. He established the Anglican Youth Organization (AYO) with the main aim of bringing the young people back to the mainstream of the Church of Christ.<br>

                In 1964, the bishop launched the Diocesan Anglican Youth Organization at the St. Paulâ€™s Mother Church, Kabete and he commissioned a Youth Committee to carry on the extension work in the Diocese. During the following Provincial Synod, all the other Bishops agreed to start AYO in their dioceses. The name was changed from AYO to KAYO so as to cover the whole country.
