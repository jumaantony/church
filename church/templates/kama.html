                    KAMA was established to create a forum for men in the Anglican Church of Kenya to fellowship and serve Christ. 
                    It also prepares men to play their God given roles within family, the church and Country. <br><br>
        
                    The Provincial KAMA in Kenya received recognition and blessing of the Provincial Synod in July 2001, by this time nearly all diocese had established KAMA.
                    Before KAMA their existed the Fatherâ€™s Union which was established in Diocese of Mt. Kenya South in 1985. 
                    It is both a privilege and responsibility to be a KAMA member because it constantly reminds men of their faith in Jesus Christ.
